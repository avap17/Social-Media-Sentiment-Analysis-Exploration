# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-Exploration Project Introduction and Goal
In this project, I analyze the sentiment analysis of various online social media posts from various users. The main points I analyze are:
- which social media platform has on average more positive posts, and more negative posts
- whether negative or positive posts get more engagement
- which country has the most positive and negative posts
# Training the Model
I train my model on the texts and mood of the texts in order to predict the sentiment analysis of a given post, using Logistic Regression.
# Dataset
Based on a dataset found from Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset?resource=download
